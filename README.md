# Employee Management System

In this repo, I create an employee management system.

I employed buttons to trigger functions such as displaying all employees, calculating total salaries, filtering and displaying HR department employees, and finding employees by their IDs. 

I then used JavaScript functions to generate dynamic lists of employees utilising array methods like forEach, filter, reduce, and find to manage and present data interactively.
